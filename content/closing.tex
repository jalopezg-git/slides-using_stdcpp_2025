\begin{frame}{Ideas to take home}
  \begin{block}{About \texttt{reinterpret\_cast}}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Most of its uses are UB; don't do it unless you are absolutely sure!
    \item Even \texttt{reinterpret\_cast$<$char *$>$} is not well-defined, but it works in practice
    \item Use \texttt{std::bit\_cast} or \texttt{std::start\_lifetime\_as} if available
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}

  \begin{block}{Type punning is only okay if\ldots}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item It doesn't break the strict aliasing rule
    \item Only accesses bytes reachable through the original pointer
    \item Complies to the alignment requirements of the type
    \item The accessed object is within its lifetime
    \item \alert{NO} \texttt{union}s, please!
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}\vspace*{-1ex}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Implement proper serialization where appropriate!
  \end{itemize}
